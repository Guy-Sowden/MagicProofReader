PROOFREADING GUIDELINESFORMATTING—PARAGRAPHS
—PUNCTUATION—HYPHENS & DASHES—FOOTNOTESN
general, make sure that the text you areproofreading matches the original book.However, ignore bold or italics appearance.
]Proofread only the content. Sometimes thetext   will   appear   with   <i>markup</i>   tags<b>around</b> it.  
Please do not add anysuch markers; you may remove them if youchoose, though.
Leave words in SMALL CAPS in whatever CASE they came to you, whether ALL CAPPED, mixed case,
or all lower case.IEach new paragraph should have a blankline before it, even at the top of the page. 
Ifa page does not start with a new paragraph,do not put a blank line at the top.In general,
ignore changes in font size. Don’t   remove   or   change  line   breaks(“carriage returns”). 
These are re-organized inpost-processing   anyway,   and   subsequent
volunteers like the text and image to match sothey can more easily compare them line-by-line.
Leave only one space after punctuation.We   do   make   some   changes   in   the   text,
though.  We remove headers and footers (such
as   the   book   or   chapter   title,   page   number),
repeated on every page.Books often put space around punctuation,
such as before a colon or semicolon; remove it.
Some old books wouldn’t close up spaces incontractions;
’tis proper to remove these.
An ellipsis ... has three dots; ... do not
leave spaces between them. 
Leave a space oneither side of it as if it were a word.  At the end
of   a   sentence,   though,   don’t   leave   a   spacebefore!...
If the sentence ends in a period thenthere will be four dots total:
one for the sentenceand three for the ellipsis...
Hyphenation.—A word that is hyphena-ted because it falls at the end of a line should
be restored to a full word (on the upper line).Do not leave the hyphen “naked” at the end ofthe line. 
For a compound word such as “well-known,” keep the hyphen when you rejoin it.
If you are unsure whether a hyphen shouldremain in a word, put an asterisk * after the hyphen when
rejoining the word, as in up-stairs, to alert the post-processor.  If a word ishyphenated across pages, type an asterisk af-
ter the hyphen; on the next page, put an asteriskbefore the 2nd half of the word.Dashes.
An em-dash—a dash as long as 2–3
letters—should be proofread with two hyphens. 
Along   dash  (the length of 4–5 letters) should bemarked   with   4   hyphens.
 Remove   any   spacesaround these dashes.  If a dash begins—or ends—a line it needs to be “clothed.”   
Don’t leave itdangling on the end——!   Move the next word—or the dash and word—up to
join the line before.A dash that ends a page is treated the same as anend-of-page hyphenation.
1Footnote markers go in square brackets at thepoint within the text where they appear.
Keepletters or numbers if used in the book, but convertspecial symbols to asterisks†.
At the bottom of thepage, proofread the footnote  like normal  text andput a blank 
line before each footnote.  Make surethat the footnote has the same markerbefore it asyou used above,
but without the square brackets.(See the footnotes at the bottom of the page.)
